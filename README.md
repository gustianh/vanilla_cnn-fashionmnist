# vanilla_cnn-fashionmnist
Fashion MNIST classification using vanilla CNN from scratch. I learn from **J. Brownlee** on Machine Learning Mastery. But, I did some modification on the source code. There are :
* **fashion-mnist_baseline** : This file contains source code that build fashion-mnist classification in a baseline. It means there is no addition like add padding. 
* **fashion-mnist_binary-classification** : From the baseline I did some to the source code, to do binary classification.
